Things and necessary things that will make this list work:

  Class node -> Piece of the linked list that will have the values
  that will be stored in the list. It has two properties:
  
    data = It will have the object that is going to be stored. CREATED

    next = The reference to the value next to the data stored in
    the node. CREATED

  Class LinkedList -> Main class that will store the nodes of created
  from the class node, its functions are going to be:

    AtBeggining() -> It will place a new node in the first element of 
    the list. CREATED

    AtEnd() -> Pass a node and append it into the list at the end of it. CREATED

    InsertAt() -> The new node will be created between a node and 
    another one changing the reference and therefore the list order 
    itself. CREATED

    get() -> Introduce a value and will return the index of the specified
    data. If not found, return none.

    getAt() -> Introduce an integer number and it will return the value
    stored within the specified node. return none if not found.

    getLength() -> return an integer of the node amount that is stored in
    the list. CREATED

    remove() -> Introduce an object and it will remove its first instance.
    Return false if not deleted, true otherwise.

    removeAt() -> Introduce an integer number and it will delete the node at
    the specified index. Return true if found, false otherwise.

    getString() -> Return a representation of the list within a string. CREATED

    Also create an interator of nodes stored in the linked list
