REMEMBER: 
  
  - NOTHING CAN BE MUTATED: create a copy in the local 
    scope and do your shit to it.

  - DON´T BE DEPENDENT: It´s strictly forbidden to use
    functions such as append or pop WHEN MANIPULATING THE ARRAY. 

    Make your own ones and play around with them in within the class.

neccesary functions to do here:

  size() --> Get the total amount of fields that you can fill in
  the array. For example, arr[19] will return 19. DONE

  isEmpty() --> Boolean value that checks wheter there is at least
  one value stored in the array DONE

  get() --> Obtain values by introducing specified index. DONE

  set() --> Introduce a value in the array by giving an index. DONE

  clear() --> Set all values in the array to Null DONE

  add() --> append the element to the final of the list. 
    - If the capacity is not enough, double the size
      and copy the array to the extended one.

  removeAt() --> Give an index and delete the data within and 
    reduce the capacity of items which can be stored in by one.

  remove() --> same as removeAt but pass the object , such 
    as a number, and delete the first instance in the array. 
    -Return True if the value was completely destroyed, 
    otherwise false.

  indexOf() --> Pass the object and return its numerical 
  position in the array.

  contains() --> Pass the object and return true if exists within
  the array, otherwise false.

  iterator() --> Create a function that allows iteration. It depends
  on your language how you do so.

  toString() --> Convert your weird looking array into something nice
  as this:

    val1, val2, valN ...

  and return it as a string.
